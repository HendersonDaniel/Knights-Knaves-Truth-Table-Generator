## Excel Truth Table Generator

This project is meant to help COMP 283 (Discrete Structures) students at UNC Chapel Hill create truth tables in Excel for the Knighs and Knaves unit. It allows users to input logical expressions which are then turned into a truth table in Excel.

## How to Access

Go to the following fork's website: https://maximdolphin.github.io/Knights-Knaves-Truth-Table-Generator/

After inputting a (or multiple) logical expressions(s), an Excel file with the truth table for the expressions(s) will automatically download.
